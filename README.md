# GS_PoplarTree

//Learning to build a deep learning model 
//based on the data of poplar tree genotypes, 
//then to predict the phenotypes for them
//by using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

Build a deep learning model for the poplar tree data.

Use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict the phenotype.

Provide visualization of the prediction results.

# About poplar data

There are:
  Five traits: "Jmax25", "Rdlight25", "Resistwp25", "WUEref" and "Av_Diameter_mm"; 
  Three thresholds: "1e-05", "1e-04" and "0.001".
